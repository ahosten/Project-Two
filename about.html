	  <h1>About Us</h1>
	  <p>
	  Learning2Live was started in 2009 with the goal of targeting students that often do not recieve the necessary help to succeed in school and life.
	  Many tutoring programs tend to focus on students that already have the foundation to do well in school, leaving the students who require help to fend
	  for themselves. Learning2Live students are students who attend St. Louis public high schoolers and have lower than a 2.0 GPA. These are the students
	  that need the most help and can benefit the most from what we do.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Learning2Live is run strictly by Washington University in St. Louis students. Each student volunteer is paired with a student and their goal is to get to know them as best 
	  and act as a role model for their mentee. Learning2Live meets every other Saturday from 11:30AM-3:00PM. The students begin their day with 45 minutes lessons in Reading and Rhetoric and
	  Math and Logic. Each lesson is taught by two student instructors. The lessons are meant to give students knowledge that is applicable in both school and
	  the real world. Many schools and tutoring programs focus on helping students succeed inside of the classroom, but do not prepare them for real life. Many students do not learn important
	  real world skills such as how to write a proper resume and prepare for an interview. Learning2Live seeks to help students learn this skills. Once the lessons are done, we provide the students 
	  with lunch. This food is often food donated by restuarants to Learning2Live. In the past we have had Pi Pizza, California Pizza Kitchen and Snarf's Sandwhiches. Once they students have finished eating,
	  there is either mentor time or a planned activity. Often during mentor time students are encouraged to meet and talk with their mentor about what's going on in their life. Many students face 
	  problems that they may not feel comfortable confronting their parents about, and having someone close to their age who they can confide in is very healthy for many students. During mentor time 
	  we may also play games with the kids and engage in other fun, relaxing activities. Other days we have events such as Career Day and Sexual Health Day to help educate the mentees on certain topics.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Many of our students are struggling academically, and may or may not graduate high school. One of our largest goals in Learning2Live is to help these students
	  graduate and go to college or trade school. Many students believe that college is not for them, or that they are not smart enough to attend a school such as WashU.
	  Learning2Live tries to help kids see that college students used to be high school students just like them and that if they work hard and are diligent in their school
	  work they can attend a four year university. Being on Washington University in St. Louis's campus helps students become comfortable on a college campus and makes it a place
	  where students can invision themself.
