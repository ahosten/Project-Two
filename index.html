          <h4>Our Mission</h4>
          <p>Learning2Live's goal is to arm students with the tools necessary to achieve not only in school, but also in life.
		  We teach students important skills that can be used both inside and outside of the classroom, such as how to formulate and 
		  deliver a clear and concise argument.</p>

          <h4>L2L Events</h4>
          <p>Learning2Live puts on a series of events for its mentees. We have career day, where we bring in adults with established careers
		  in a variety of fields and have them talk to the kids about what they do in their careers and how they decided to pursue the field that 
		  they are in. In the past we have had professors, musicians, nurses and lawyers. During this day we also help the kids polish their interview skills and write and review their resumes
		  so that they are prepared to enter the job market when they are ready. We also put on a sexual health day where we help educate kids on safe sex and importance of using protection
		  and getting regularly tested. This year we had a group come in that put on short skits about sexual health. We also hold ACT/SAT prep, where the students are given instruction on how to
		  best prepare for the ACT/SAT exams. In the Reading and Rhetoric and Math and Logic sections of the day the students are given exercises to help them prepare for the exams.</p>
